# passwordGenerator
homework3

7/12
Started by creating a variable to hold the user input from the prompt, "How many characters would you like your password to contain?"

Created conditional statements to confirm that the number chosen is at least 8 and no more than 128.

Created an alert to confirm the user's chosen number of characters.

Still trying to work out how to ensure that the user input is a number and NOT a string...
