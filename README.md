7/12
Started by creating a variable to hold the user input from the prompt, "How many characters would you like your password to contain?"

Created conditional statements to confirm that the number chosen is at least 8 and no more than 128.

Created an alert to confirm the user's chosen number of characters.

Still trying to work out how to ensure that the user input is a number and NOT a string...

Created a confirm to ask if user wants to "include special characters?"

Created an array "special" to include 10 special characters and log them to console.

Created steps to select a random character from the array "special" and log to console.

Created 3 seperate confirms to ask if user wants to "include numeric characters?" "include lowercase characters?" and "include uppercase characters?"

Created 3 arrays, "number", "lowercase", and "uppercase" and logged to console.

Created steps to generate a random character from each of numeric, lowercase, and uppercase arrays.

Concatenated the first four characters, one from each array, and logged to console.
